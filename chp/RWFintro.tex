 \section{Indian Railways captive wheelset plant}
 Indian Railways network spans more than 65000 route kms. The rolling stock fleet    consists of over 9000 locomotives, 58000 passenger and other coaching vehicles and 230000 freight vehicles. Rail Wheel Factory largely meets the Indian Railwaysâ€™ requirement of wheels, axle and wheel sets.Till early 1980s, Indian Railways were heavily dependent on imports for meeting their requirement of wheels and axles.

As step towards building self-sufficiency in production of railway wheels and axles. It was decided to set up a wheels \& axle plant in 1978 which is the only integrated plant in the world   to manufacture wheels, axles and wheel sets under one roof.

An extensive study was made of the latest technology and equipment available globally, possibility and foreign exchange requirement.

  
Based on study IR decided to:

(i) Adopt the cast wheel technology developed by M/s Griffin Wheel Co., USA for wheel manufacture. American Railroads have been using cast wheels for freight operations while European Railways use forged wheels. Adoption of cast wheel technology was found more suitable as the productivity of the plant is higher and cost of production lower as compared to forged wheels.




(ii) Undertake axle forging on special purpose long forging machine followed by heat treatment furnaces with automated conveyors for movement of axles.



(iii) Provide axle-machining facilities incorporating profile copying lathes, special purpose end machining equipment and a wheel set assembly complex, with integrated engineering for handling and movement of axles.




 Well established manufacturing process and high level of quality control, both during and after manufacturing results in a world class product. RWF stands for total quality, environment awareness and customer orientation. It would not be amiss to say that the Indian Railways today run on RWF manufactured wheels \& axles.
Specification of machinery \& plant layout were finalized by the team of expert officers which was deputed to works of our collaborators for wheel manufacture viz; M/s Griffin wheel company, USA.
