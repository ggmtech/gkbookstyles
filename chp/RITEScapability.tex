\subsection{Appropriate Technology}


\bigskip

{\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.039215688}
A significant aspect of the RITES experience is its closed association with the transformation of the Indian Railways
from near total dependence on foreign technology to self-reliance in the environment of a developing economy and
inadequacy of resources.}


\bigskip

{\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.039215688}
One of the most vital aspects of self-reliance has been that extreme care is taken while selecting technology and
rolling stock designs to ensure total compatibility with local environmental and service conditions as well as the
operations and maintenance capabilities, keeping in view, of course, the availability of resources. Further adopting
and modifying, these technologies and rolling stock have been an important activity to which a great deal of effort has
been devoted. Thus it has been ensured that the most appropriate and cost effective solutions found for all
requirements.}


\bigskip

{\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.039215688}

and have firsthand experience of design and manufacture of rolling stock for which India is now totally
self-sufficient.}

\section{Financial Status of RITES}


RITES is a Government of India Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways and has full support of Indian Railways for
successful execution of projects. Its financial status is sound.
%as can be seen from the Annual reports of the company, placed at {\dots}{\dots}{\dots}.. of participation documents.




\section{Specific experience in Rehabilation of Locomotives}

\subsubsection{Tanzania Railways}
RITES have undertaken the Rehabilitation Repairs of 10 Nos. 73 Class Diesel Electric Locomotives for
Tanzania Railways. In this all the Assemblies/ Components as under were either overhauled or replaced on condition
basis with the new ones:


\textbf{Mechanical - }Chassis / Under truck -- Bogie Frame- Wheels and allied Assemblies/ Components / Hoods / Power
Pack -- consisting of all the items of Engine Block, all types of Oil System, Cooling System, Air Brake System,
Painting.

\bigskip

\textbf{Electrical - }Traction motors/ Generators, Excitation System, Generator / Control panel/Wiring, Power Cables-
Batteries and other allied Assemblies/ Components related to Locomotive Electrics.

\bigskip
\subsubsection{Sudan Railways}
RITES have undertaken the Rehabilitation Repairs of 4 Hitachi Locomotives for Sudan Railways
Corporation. In this all the Assemblies/ Components were either overhauled or replaced on condition basis with the new
ones:


\textbf{Mechanical - }Radiator fan Drive Assy, Main Engine Crank Shaft, RTTM/ FTTM Blower Assy., Turbo Complete,
Springs/Shock Absorber, Radiators/Piston/ Main Bearing Set/Cylinder Heads/Cylinder Liners, Connecting Rods and
bearings/ Cam Shaft Set, All fasteners/ Gaskets / filters / Bearings, F. I. Nozzles, Air Brake Assemblies/Buffers and
allied Components, Composite Brake blocks, Axle Box Bearings, Bull Gear \& TM pinion, Cam Shaft Gears, Connecting Rods,
Crank Shaft Gear, Horizontal Shaft Hubs, Idler adjuster/ FP support/ Valve Levers, Motor Suspension Unit


\bigskip


\textbf{Electrical - }Crank Case Exhauster Motor, Dust Exhaust Motor, Dynamic Blower Motor, Fuel Pump Motor, Auxiliary
generator, Traction alternator, Batteries, All wirings / cables, Excitation System, Control Panel Assemblies/
Components, All lights- Classification Lights/ Flasher Unit/ Head Light
\bigskip


\subsection{RITES have supplied 23 cape gauge Locomotives to CFM Mozambique}
These locomotives were supplied after complete overhaul and necessary modifications to suit cape gauge. All the
Assemblies/ Components were either overhauled or replaced on condition basis with the new ones. \ The bogies of these
locos after modification/ rehabilitation were made fit for operation on cape gauge. n Locomotives were provided with
Air Brake system as per the requirement of the CFM Railways, Mozambique. Further to this Electric Panel and allied
Assemblies/ Components were also modified.


\subsection{Myanma Railways}
RITES have supplied more than 50 Meter gauge Locomotives to Myanama Railways, which are being used there since
last 10 years. These were in-service locomotives and all the Assemblies/ Components were either overhauled or replaced
on condition basis with the new ones. \ Modifications in brakes and couplers were done to suit the requirements of the
railway.


\bigskip


\subsection{Rehabilation of Canadian Locomotives for Mozambique}
RITES rehabilitated two MLW Class 88 Canadian built Locomotives of Tanzanian Railway by re-engineering the
design and increasing the Horse power of these locomotives from 1880 HP to 2300 HP. These locos were dispatched after
successful Rebuilding in DMW Patiala.~All major electrical \& mechanical assemblies/ sub-assemblies of existing Diesel
Locomotive design over Indian Railways were fitted for ease of maintenance \& availability of spares.~Driver's Cab was
converted from single control stand to dual control stand to facilitate the driving locomotive in both directions.
\bigskip

 Being the authorized agency to handle exports and other technical assistance to foreign clients,
RITES draws extensively upon the strengths and capabilities of Indian Railways. The IR production units and workshops
readily support the projects of RITES. Brief description of the IR capabilities is therefore in order:

\subsection{Diesel Locomotives}

Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) at Varanasi (India) was established in the year 1961 for manufacture of the diesel
electric locomotives in collaboration with M/s ALCO PRODUCTS INC OF USA. The Transfer of Technology agreement
was~signed with EMD in the year 1995 and the first indigenous EMD WDG4 freight loco manufactured in the year 2002. The
first indigenous passenger version of EMD loco WDP4 manufactured in 2003. DLW manufactured first WDG4 locomotive
equipped with IGBT based converter in the year 2006. The installed capacity is to manufacture 275 locomotives in a
year. So far DLW has built over 6000 diesel-electric locomotives. Locomotives built by DLW, an ISO 9000, ISO 14000 and
ISO 18000 certified unit, not only meet the demand of Indian Railways but also of the Steel Plants, Thermal Power
Houses and ports in the country. It has so far supplied 422 locos to non-railway customers in India besides export of
more than 100 locomotives for Tanzania, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mozambique and Sri Lanka.



\subsection{Locomotive Rebuilding}

The midlife rebuilding of diesel electric locomotives is done at Diesel Modernization Works (DMW), Patiala a most modern
factory of Indian Railways having ISO 9000 AND ISO 14000 accredited quality assurance management standards. Over 1000
locomotives so far have been rebuilt with a current annual out turn of more than 100 locomotives. The latest
improvements and modifications in the design such as AC-AC transmission, improved fuel efficiency and air intake
filtration have been incorporated in the re-built locos. \ This ongoing work has given Indian Railways the expertise in
improving performance parameters of the existing in-service aging fleet of diesel electric locomotives. \ DMW also
manufactures loco components; renews power packs and traction machines. \ By supplying spare parts and remanufactured
assemblies DMW provides maintenance support to the fleet of 5000 diesel electric locomotives of Indian Railways. The
other activities \& products are given below:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.039215688}
Incorporating various modifications to enhance the efficiency, reliability, safety of locomotive.}
\item {\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.039215688}
Manufacture of various types of carbon brushes used on traction.}
\item {\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.039215688}
Reconditioning of CO-CO Bogies.}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsection{Maintenance and Repair}

There are 46 major workshops for the maintenance of locomotives, coaches and wagons on the Railway
System in which periodic overhaul and rehabilitation work is undertaken. The major repair workshops of Indian Railways
also undertake design modifications to continuously improve the performance and reliability of the rolling stock.
